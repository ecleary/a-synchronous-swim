Questions to ask for clarity:

server/spec/mockServer.js
- What is the proper term for the 'request' and 'response' variables? (They look like class/constructor but are not capitalized.)

server- at mockServer data request
-What is the data being requested? => swim team movement inputs/html placements/

How does server and client interact with each other? Are there patterns or just that connection?

Trying to implmented working functionality but not sure where to implement?
(Related to instruction: "Write a test to verify the server responds with a random swim command to a GET request.")
